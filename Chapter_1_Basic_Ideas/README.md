## Standard Libraries

* The ___Standard Library___ is a huge collection of __routines__ and __definitions__ that provide the __functionality__ required by many programs.
* For example:
    - `String` processing,
    - `Input/Output (I/O)` operations,
    - `Concurrency` and `Synchronization`,
    - `Sorting` and `Searching`
    - and the list goes on.
